## Abstract

The Indian IT industry has emerged as the largest private-sector employer in the country. It also
emerged as the go-to industry for the woman to gravitate towards because of the economic and
societal mobility it promises. The barrier of conventional higher academia makes entry into the
workforce difficult. It often requires significant time and capital investment only accessible to the
privileged few. On top of professional stigma, women have to face this is what drove us to build
inSight.

inSight is a digital platform FOR women. At inSight we plan on upskilling women, empowering them
with inclusion in the workforce, creating a safe space without the fear of cyber harassment. Our
online platform consists of four domains, inSpireEdu, inWork and imPactHub.

Upskilling was the primary driving force in the development of inSpireEdu. Women are
systematically tracked away from STEM, limiting their training. inSpireEdu strives to be a one-stop
roadmap to upskilling into the industry's most in-demand fields. The curated courses provided are
self-paced and equip the individual with the skills to dip their foot into the industry.

At inWork, we are on a mission to impart the necessary practical exposure through internships and
job opportunities for financial stability. Our supportive framework enables employers to post
vacancies on inWork, which are updated in real-time. We created inWork on the guiding principles
of empowerment and inclusivity.

ImpactHub is a community platform that unites women and helps them traverse the challenges of
living in a patriarchal society. It is a safe space for our users to network without the fear of cyber
harassment because our approach to handling cyberbullying is preventative. We use machine
learning sentiment analysis to implement a filter that prevents inappropriate messages from being
posted on the forums.

The driving force for inSight is and always will be to live in a world devoid of current prejudices and
discrimination and allows women to be independent, equal, and empowered members of society.
We desire to create a virtuous cycle where we can develop a sense of community that succeeds,
flourishes, and in turn, is inspired to help the next generation of women make their mark on this
industry.
